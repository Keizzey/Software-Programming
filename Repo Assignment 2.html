        <b>Proverbs 31:10b-12</b>...<br>
        10 [b]A wife of noble character who can find?
            She is worth far more than rubies.
        11 Her husband has full confidence in her
            and lacks nothing of value.
        12 She brings him good, not harm,
            all the days of her life.</p>

<p><b>Proverbs 31:28-31...</b><br>
    28 Her children arise and call her blessed;
    her husband also, and he praises her:
29 ‚ÄúMany women do noble things,
    but you surpass them all.‚Äù
30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting;
    but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised.
31 Honor her for all that her hands have done,
    and let her works bring her praise at the city gate.
